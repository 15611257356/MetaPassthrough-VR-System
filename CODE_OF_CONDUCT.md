# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers of **MetaPassthrough-VR-System** pledge to make participation in this project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for collaboration, research, and development.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

* Using respectful and inclusive language
* Being considerate of different viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Prioritizing what is best for the project and the community
* Showing empathy and support for other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, or personal/political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information (such as physical or electronic addresses) without permission
* Other conduct that would reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or academic setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate corrective action in response to unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other inappropriate, threatening, or harmful behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, as well as in public spaces when someone is representing the project or community. Examples of representation include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as a representative at an event.

It also applies outside the project spaces if an individual's behavior negatively impacts the project or its community.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainer at **whr15611257356@163.com**.  

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, resulting in a response deemed appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent consequences, as determined by other members of the project leadership.
